      <h2 class="subhead">About Me</h2>
      I am currently a PhD Computer Science student at the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a> (at <a href="https://www.lucy.cam.ac.uk/">Lucy Cavendish College</a>), focusing on Natural Language Processing. I am co-supervised
      by <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/">Simone Teufel</a>
      (University of Cambridge) and <a href="https://rycolab.github.io/">Ryan Cotterell</a> (ETH Zurich). I am currently funded by the
      <a href="https://www.esrcdtp.group.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge ESRC DTP</a>. I previously completed an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at Cambridge, achieving a Distinction. During this time I was funded by a 2019/2020 <a
        href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/deepmind-scholars-cambridge">DeepMind Scholarship</a>.
      <p>
        I’m interested in interpretability of NLP models, techniques for low-resource NLP, gender bias in NLP and annotation of linguistic data, among other things.
      <p>
        Previously, I graduated with an Integrated Master’s Degree in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Warwick in 2016. My focus was on Algebraic Geometry. Following this, I worked as a Software Engineer for 3 years before returning to
        university.
      <p>
        In my spare time, I like studying more languages than any individual should attempt at once, eating katsu curry and travelling (when the world is not in a state of lockdown).
