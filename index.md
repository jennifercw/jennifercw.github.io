## About Me

I am currently a student at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) studying MPhil Advanced Computer Science, focusing on Natural Language Processing. I am supervised by [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.github.io/). I am a 2019/2020 [DeepMind Scholar](https://www.cambridgetrust.org/scholarships/deepmind-cambridge-scholarship/). In October 2020 I will be beginning my PhD at Cambridge, co-supervised by Simone Teufel and Ryan Cotterell.

I'm interested in techniques for low-resource NLP, gender bias in NLP and annotation of linguistic data, among other things. 

Previously, I graduated with an Integrated Master's Degree in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Warwick in 2016. My focus was on Algebraic Geometry. Following this, I worked as a Software Engineer for 3 years before returning to university.
