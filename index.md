## About Me

I am currently a PhD Computer Science student at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), focusing on Natural Language Processing. I am co-supervised by Simone Teufel (University of Cambridge) and [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.github.io/) (ETH Zurich). I am currently funded by the [Cambridge ESRC DTP](https://www.esrcdtp.group.cam.ac.uk/). I previously completed an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at Cambridge, achieving a Distinction. During this time I was funded by a 2019/2020 [DeepMind Scholarship](https://www.cambridgetrust.org/scholarships/deepmind-cambridge-scholarship/).

I'm interested in interpretability of NLP models, techniques for low-resource NLP, gender bias in NLP and annotation of linguistic data, among other things. 

Previously, I graduated with an Integrated Master's Degree in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Warwick in 2016. My focus was on Algebraic Geometry. Following this, I worked as a Software Engineer for 3 years before returning to university.

In my spare time, I like studying more languages than any individual should attempt at once, eating katsu curry and travelling (when the world is not in a state of lockdown).
